3. number The number of blocks actually dropped

#### dropLeft()
```
mollusk.dropLeft([count [, pause]])
```
Drops items from the selected slot to the left of the turtle. Can handle negative numbers (it will work like opposite function - suckLeft). If count is greater than 64, the turtle will first try to drop identical blocks from the same slot, then move to other slots.
##### Parameters
1. count=64 : number The number of items to drop. If greater than 64, the turtle will attempt to drop from multiple slots.
2. pause=0 : number The time in seconds to wait between each item dropped
